2)
Given an unsorted array Arr of size N of positive integers. One number 'A' from set {1, 2, â€¦N} is missing and one number 'B' occurs twice in array. Find these two numbers.

Example 1:

Input:
N = 2
Arr[] = {2, 2}
Output: 2 1
Explanation: Repeating number is 2 and 
smallest positive missing number is 1.
Example 2:

Input:
N = 3
Arr[] = {1, 3, 3}
Output: 3 2
Explanation: Repeating number is 3 and 
smallest positive missing number is 2.



3) Next greater element in an array
Example

arr[]= {112, 133, 161, 311, 122, 
                    512, 1212, 0, 19212}
nextgreater(112) : 133
nextgreater(133) : 161
nextgreater(161) : 311
nextgreater(311) : 512
nextgreater(122) : 512
nextgreater(512) : 1212
nextgreater(1212) : 19212
nextgreater(0) : 19212
nextgreater(19212) : 0
